# Bitcoin_Basic_Transactions_and_Scripts

This repository contains code for creating a Bitcoin Address, fetching the last Block from the Block Chain(the stored Block with the biggest height in Block Chain) and providing some vital information concerning itself and some of its transactions, for example the first transaction which is called Basecoin Transaction. Moreover this repository gives the functionallity for constructing scripts and implementing the most common transactions of the Bitcoin Protocol with the aid of BitcoinJ Library. 

This demand for implementing the most common Transactions,Pay to PubKey Hash,Pay to PubKey,Pay to Script Hash,Multi-Signature and Null Data stemed from the need to have a closer look of how Bitcoin Transactions work in the context of my thesis as an undergraduate student of Department of Applied Informatics at the University of Macedonia,Greece.
